You tried to transfer a GitHub repository from one account to another, but did not receive a confirmation email regarding the transfer?

Make sure you have only **one** email in your email settings of the receiving GitHub account:

&rarr; Click on your profile picture on the top-right corner of GitHub's webpage 
<br>
&rarr; then, select Settings 
<br>
&rarr; then, select Emails. 

Remove all the other emails except the one for which you are expecting to receive the confirmation email message.
