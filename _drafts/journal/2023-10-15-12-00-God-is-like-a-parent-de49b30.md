I've been reading the book ["The Bible and Ethics"](https://www.myrtlefieldhouse.com/online-books/the-bible-and-ethics) by David Gooding and John Lennox. Chapter five of the book has this very interesting illustration of the relationship between God and man in the Garden of Eden:

> Fire is a very dangerous thing. A wise and loving parent, therefore, will forbid a young child to
touch or light a fire, until the parent has had time to teach the child what destruction fire can cause if mishandled. So God forbade man, in his innocence, to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. **How God would have eventually shown man the destructive results of disobedience and evil, and so have taught man to avoid evil, we are not told.** For man chose to act independently of God, to disobey
God; and so learned by grievously sad personal suffering the terrible consequences of evil.

That illustration reminded of me of passages from the Bible which portrays God as a loving parent to us.

[googling...]

> Deuteronomy 8:5
> You should know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.

> Psalm 86:15
> As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.


That illustration also helps us get a better understanding of what "knowing good and evil" in Genesis 3:5 means.


I had learned from [Michael Heiser](https://lexhampress.com/product/49583/the-unseen-realm-recovering-the-supernatural-worldview-of-the-bible) and from others that "knowing good and evil" does not mean "will be capable of good and evil":

> As free-will beings, Adam and Eve were already capable of disobedience... they were imperfect. But Adam and Eve had not yet experienced evil---either by their own commission or as bystanders.



> Genesis tells us that all the trees in the
garden of Eden were put there for man’s delight and enjoyment,
except one: the fruit of this tree God strictly forbade
man to eat, and warned him that if he disobeyed and ate
it, he would die. But the very fact that God had to warn
man what the consequences of disobeying the prohibition
would be shows us that God had made man in such a way
that he was able to disobey God if he chose to.







Just putting it here because it might help someone in the future know if an AI has gone from being innocent to 

	Test whether an AI has acquired free will :)




Genesis tells us that all the trees in the
garden of Eden were put there for man’s delight and enjoyment,
except one: the fruit of this tree God strictly forbade
man to eat, and warned him that if he disobeyed and ate
it, he would die. But the very fact that God had to warn
man what the consequences of disobeying the prohibition
would be shows us that God had made man in such a way
that he was able to disobey God if he chose to. In other
words, God had made man with a free will.

Now an illustration. Fire is a very dangerous thing. A wise
and loving parent, therefore, will forbid a young child to
touch or light a fire, until the parent has had time to teach
the child what destruction fire can cause if mishandled. So
God forbade man, in his innocence, to eat from the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil. How God would have eventually
shown man the destructive results of disobedience
and evil, and so have taught man to avoid evil, we are not
told. For man chose to act independently of God, to disobey
God; and so learned by grievously sad personal suffering the
terrible consequences of evil. Why ever did man do it?



(Can add questions: Could humans still have sinned even if the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not there?)
