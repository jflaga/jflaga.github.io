I had read from Micheal Heiser that _"knowing good and evil"_ in Genesis 2 does not mean knowing what is morally right and wrong. It has something to do with being innocent or not, as cross-referenced Deuteronomy 1:39 suggests.

But Genesis 2 also says that God _knows good and evil_. What does that mean? I was searching for an explanation to that, and found [this](https://www.mercyonall.org/posts/what-is-the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil):

> Now let’s consider how this understanding of “the knowledge of tov and ra” might inform our understanding of the Atonement. Humanity’s fearful distrust of God, which began with Adam and Eve, could only be overcome by the vision of God’s goodness as seen on the cross. When God made himself vulnerable to mankind through the incarnation, we did our worst to him. But instead of retaliating with destructive, all-consuming wrath, which is certainly within God’s power, he instead refrained, and chose the path of mercy. It is within God’s power to destroy, but he desires reconciliation. The cross was the ultimate exposition of the merciful restraint of which God is capable. It is an invitation to trust in the goodness of his heart. Is God safe? By no means. But the cross shows us that he is good.

_"Is God safe? By no means."_

I remember Jordan Peterson's words after reading that (ex., [here](https://x.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1458822116686581767?s=20) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYAgXdE9FIc)):

<!-- NOTE: Jordan Peterson - "You cannot be good if you are not dangerous." -->

God is dangerous, but he is also merciful.

Reflecting on that, I came to remember the danger of focusing only on one character of God without considering his whole character as reveled to us in scriptures, and which are confirmed in our personal experiences:

If we focus only on God's judgement to those who do not follow his commands, without considering his love and mercy and grace, we tend to border towards what they call [legalism](https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/what-is-legalism);

If we focus only on God's love, without considering his justice and the call of following him, we lean towards promoting what they call [cheap](https://www.gotquestions.org/cheap-grace.html) [grace](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/the-skim-milk-gospel-of-cheap-grace/)


I grew up in an environment where God's judgement is emphasized more than his love. During my late teenage years, I experienced rebellion against God (mainly because of a misunderstanding of his character). I wanted him out of my life. I did not want to believe in him anymore. I expected that God would kill me soon, through an accident maybe. But I'm still alive today.

I realized that God does not work in ways which I thought he does. What I thought about God's character was too simplistic. He works in more complex ways.

I'm writing about this because considering God's whole character is very relevant to an idea which has been on my mind for about three months now --- the idea of writing satire (and non satire) about [satirical] movements called Wycliffe-Purvey Only, Wycliffe Only, Tyndale Only, ESV Only, etc. The purpose of these satirical movements is to combat KJV Onlyism (especially the extreme variation). I'm in the process of writing a journal entry for that.

Also, a few days ago, my brother asked me if an article he found online is a good answer to someone who asks why John 5:7 in the KJV contains words which are not in other translations of the Bible. The article he is refering to is this: ["Is 1 John 5:7 not in any Greek manuscript before the 1600s? If it is true, why is it in the KJV?"](https://www.chick.com/information/article?id=is-i-john-5:7-missing-from-older-manuscripts) from Chick Publications.

Now, I tend to be skeptical of materials from Chick Publications because they have been accused of publishing questionable materials before. But I did not, and still do not, have all the time in the world to verify the claims in that article. So I just pointed out some inconsistencies in that article. I might write a separate journal entry for that, and give my take to the question which goes like "Why did God allow his word to be corrupted?" or something like that. But in this journal entry I want to talk about a major claim being made by KJV Onlyists (of which I was one, by the way), then connect that to the character of God:

One of the primary claims of KJV Onlyism is that "everything" which comes from Antioch is good, while "everything" which comes from Alexandria, Egypt is bad (the word "everything" is just an exaggeration here, but I hope you get the point). An example laying out of that thesis can be found in ["Where Do Bible Manuscripts Come From?"](https://www.chick.com/information/article?id=where-bible-manuscripts-come-from)

Now, can God make everything which comes from Antioch good? Yes he can.

Can God make everything which comes from Alexandria, Egypt bad? Yes he can.

But is that how God works? No.<sup>*</sup>



Paul and Barnabas had their fight in Antioch. They went their separate ways from Antioch.

Jacob went to Egypt to buy food during famine. They experience living good life in Egypt. 

Mary and Joseph went to Egypt to save their lives and Jesus' life.


====================



God does not work like this:
 - Everything which came from and everything that happened in Antioch, Syria is good.
 - Everything which came from and everything that happened in Alexandria, Egypt is bad.



Paul started all his missionary journeys 


God does not work like this:

 - if a manuscript came from the Antiochian line of manuscripts


 - If someone is named Judas or Jude, then everything they do is evil.
 - If someone is named Paul or Peter, then everything they do is good.

The world does not work that way. That is not how "reality" works.

God has not appointed rules in the universe which work that way. If that's how God made the universe to work, we can just rename everyone "Jesus" and all the problems and conflicts in the world will be solved.

Footnotes:

* If you do not like attributing things to God, we can rephrase that as "that is not how 'reality' works". 

This is partly the reason why both theists and non-theists can be competent scientists: one can learn about how the universe works with or without acknowedging what or who  - link here William Lane Craig

I don't agree with those who say that knowing or endeavoring to know "how" things work and not endeavoring to know why it works or what is the purpose why it works that way.

For example, if we do not accept the "claim" (or even just entertain it seriously) that the universe was made for the good/benefit of humankind, then if someone "claims" that the universe was made for "lions" or for "trees" or for "tall humans" or for an ideaology, we might believe them and then feed ourselves to lions or to trees or to tall humans or to an ideology, even using our knowledge of the "how" to create things to make that feeding program more efficient.

From a programmer's perspective, the "why" or "what" is as important, or even more important, than the "how".


People who think that only the "how" is important have spent a big portion of their lives learning about the "how" and they survived, and so they think that only the "how" is important.

They are like the programmers, myself included, who have spent their entire lives learning about specific software development technologies and methodologies, and have forgotten that the software development technologies and methodologies are just a means to an end, not the end in itself (most of the time, at least; if you can point out an example of which that is not the case, please say so in the comments section). It might have started as an end in itself (because writing softare is pleasurable to some people, which I think is the case to programmers), but eventually we will realize that it is not the end in itself. 

In software, giving value only to the "how" without thinking about the "what" and the "why" eventuallly results into a garbled mess. I think the same is true with humanity.

We can just rename all places "Antioch" or "Heaven", then everything in which happen afterwards will be good.


We wish that God would work like we want him to.


Now I know almost nothing about manuscripts. I'm just trying to point out that it is wrong to think that if 






I've been writing a personal journal titled "Satirical 'Wycliffe-Purvey Only' movement, 'Tyndale Only' movement, 'ESV Only' movement, etc."
