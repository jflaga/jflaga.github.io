[Steve Patterson's childhood experience of being "lied to" about Santa Claus](https://steve-patterson.com/a-seed-of-doubt-experts-and-incompetence/) was devastating to him.  

> "Disillusionment is powerful."

That is what he said while relaying his experience.

I think that experience led him to be very skeptical of many things commonly accepted in our society today. I think it served him good to have realized very early in life that not everything that the adults make us believe are true. It serves us good, I think, that he is writing about his skepticism.

I too have experienced many disillusionments growing up:

1. KJV Onlyism (ref. [How we got our Bible: The KJV Only Movement](https://crossexamined.org/how-we-got-our-bible-the-kjv-only-movement/))
2. sacred/secular distinction - (ref. ["Nothing is secular."]https://crossexamined.org/morality-and-politics/))
3. the YEC interpretation is the only Biblical interpretation of Genesis (ref. [What Ken Ham Misses About Creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL9t3O-1E7w&t=1171s))
4. Baptists have always existed since the early years of Christianity (some even teach that Jesus was a Baptist!) - (ref. [Mopping Up the Trail of Blood](https://web.archive.org/web/20230108004806/https://covenantlegacy.com/mopping-up-the-trail-of-blood-part-1/))
5. cigarrette smokers and alcohol consumers are some of the most evil people in the world - (ref. [[Spurgeon] Smoked Cigars and Drank Alcoholic Beverages](https://recognizingchrist.com/2016/05/31/he-smoked-cigars-and-drank-alcoholic-beverages/))
6. etc.

In my estimation, the first one in that list, KJV Onlyism, had the greatest _negative_ impact on me. Unlike Steve Patterson's experience, I think I was not lied to by people who taught it to me. I think they were sincere. But it almost destroyed me. By "destroyed" I mean it almost destroyed my relationship with God, which is what destruction ultimately means. So in my own simple ways, I'm going to write things to combat some ideas being presented by its advocates (of whome I was one).

But I do not have a plan of writing on the other topics listed above because they did not have significant negative impact on me. I don't have that much motivation and I don't have that much experiential knowledge to write about those things.

Now, why do I think that KJV Onlyism almost destroyed me? It's because it made me ask questions like:

 - "Why do the majority of professing Christians not KJV Only advocates when all these other translations are products of corrupt manuscripts."
 - Why did God allow that to happen?
 - Why did God even allow Bible manuscripts to be corrupted? 

That last question could lead to questions like 

 - "Why did God allow people to corrupt bible manuscripts?" 
 
Which can eventually lead to questions like 

 - "Why did God allow Adam and Eve to rebel against him?" --- which has potential answers available if you search online. (ex. Chapter 5 of ["The Bible and Ethics"](https://www.myrtlefieldhouse.com/online-books/the-bible-and-ethics) by David Gooding and John Lennox; ["The Shocking Alternative"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxzuh5Xx5G4) chapter of Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis)

 - "Why did not God make Adam and Eve to be like robots who cannot decide for themselves?" --- I'm just joking on this one

But the more dangerous questions are those which leads to questioning the charater of God, like this one:

 - "If the Bible is not perfect, and the Bible is God's word, does that mean that God is also not perfect?"
 - "If the perfect word of God is in the KJV which was published in 1611, where is the perfect word of God before that?"
 - "The Greek Text compiled be Erasmus, named Textus Receptus, was the main basis in the translation of the KJV."
 - "Is Textus Receptus also perfect? If Textus Receptus is perfect, are the first and second editions of this text also perfect?"
 - and on and on...

If you are someone who have been convinced that the KJV is the inspired and preserved word of God, your world will be shattered when you have or hear questions like that and do not get answers.

But not so fast. There is an answer to that... -- No one knows everything, so you have to eventually take it on faith. --- And "faith" here means blindly accepting something to be true without evidence.

But "faith" is not supposed to mean that, from the Christian's point of view.

If you think faith means blindly accepting something to be true even in the absence of evidence, then you are like those materialist athiests who say "God does not exist" even though they have not been to every corner of the universe since the beginning of time until now to see if God was anywhere or not. (I'm not saying that all athiests think like that.)

This satirical movement is for the younger generation.

I am not in the goal of convincing the older generation of church leader who were not accustomed to verifying things by googling them first 





It almost destroyed me. By "destroyed" I mean it almost destroyed my relationship with God, which is what destruction ultimately means.





Not the best one to do this because I'm not that very knowledgeable. I just have the motivation to do this in hopes that others will not come to the same experience as I did, or others who have experienced the same will know that he/she is not alone.

I'm hoping that someone more knowledgeable will ...

<!-- Note: This is satire. This is not an attack on the KJV Bible. This is also not an attack on the Wycliffe-Purvey Bible -->












For ESV Only movement (or Why am I an ESV Only proponent)

older translations: product of Enlightenment period, rise of atheism

ESV: product of period where we have prosperity, God has truly blessed this period

It has 3 revisions, unlike the older tanslations which is never revised. 

It is still putting false hopes in the souls of 

mansions with places inside them

And encouraging drunkards to continue with their drunkennes because Jesus himself truned water into wine

 

 as a nurse




There are people who are dear to me who hold on to this view. I am not writing this for them. They are older than me, so I think it's impossible to change their minds on this issue.

I am writing these to my generation who might be facing issues which the older generation has not faced, and which KJV onlyism cannot help resolve, and might be actually detrimental to their faith.

I'm writing this for those whose faith is or will be affected by this view, expecially the younger generation or my own generation.





I'm not the best to do this but I have to start it
I'm hoping someone more capable will 




Missing out on very valuable materials such as Study Bibles or books...



Dr. Antolin Zamar - keep under your body
keep your body under

After a moment of consideration, I realized that Sir Zamar was right. "Keep under my body" can be rephrased into "Keep my body under". And that does not seem changing the Word of God. It actually makes it more understandable (to me at least).

If I remember correctly, I did not understand what "keep under my body" before that conversation. --- Does it mean "hide under my body"? What does "hide under my body" even mean?. --- But I did understand "bring it into subjection".

That incident also made me realize that 

In my native tongue I can still understand a sentence or phrase even when words are  baliktad-baliktaron.

The younger generations might face problems which will dumbfound Christians trained/raised in KJV-onlyism.
