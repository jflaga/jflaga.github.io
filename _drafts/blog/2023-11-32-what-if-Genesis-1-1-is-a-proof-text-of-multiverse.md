> "In the beginning"

That is from the Wycliffe-Purvey and the 

These books were written centuries ago.

What if the definitions of the words "in", "the", and "beginning" have changed?

in - inside

the - a

beginning - a thing which has an inside and an outside

Given the hypothetical definitions above, Genesis 1:1 could could be rephrase as "Inside a beginning God created the heaven and the earth"

That means there are lots of beginnings.

Perhaps "a beginning" refers to a universe: the universe inside which we live.

"Inside a universe (among many universes) God created the heaven and the earth."

Genesis 1:1 is a proof text for the idea of multiverse!

Multiverse is in the Bible!

Not too fast...

Before we accept that conclusion we should first ask this question:

How would we know that we are not misinterpreting passages we read in an old book?

One way is to get a dictionary that is as old as that old book we are reading.


Another way is to get a translation ... Or we can read a translation nga duol sa atong year of existence.
