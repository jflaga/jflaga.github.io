I have been reading the book "Near Christianity" by Anthony Le Donne, and I learned something new about the Pharisees.

In page 115-116 of the book, it says:

> Jesus and the Pharisees had a great deal in common. Far from being the hateful elitists or hypocrites of Christian imagination, the historical Pharisees, were among the most liberal readers of legal instruction and the most representative of common folk in Jesus' day.

> In their first-century context, Pharisees varied widely in a number of respects. But even when their general characteristics are summarized, they do not turn out to be all that different from Jesus. Jesus probably argues most often with the Pharisees because he has the most in common with them.

That is confirmed in another book in my reading list: Accidental Pharisees by Larry Osborne.

In page 23-24, it says:

> A few years ago I had the opportunity to speak at a friend's church. I started by telling everyone how happy I was to be there. I then shared how their pastor had told me that his church was full of Pharisees.I told them that after spending a few days with the staff and key leaders, I had to agree...
>
> I went on to explain that calling someone a Pharisee wasn't always considered such a social faux pas. In fact, in Jesus' day it would have been a great way to start a sermon. I was just a couple of thousand years too late.

> In Jesus' day, being called a Pharisee was a badge of honor. It was a compliment, not a slam.
>
> That's because first-century Pharisees excelled in everything we admire spiritually.

> The Pharisees were held in such a high regard that both Jesus and the apostle Paul played the Pharisee card when they wanted to illustrate the highest levels of spiritual commitment. They knew their audience would be impresses.
