I finished reading the book "Accidental Pharisees" by Larry Osborne last week.

Today, I remembered what I read in that book about the early Christians expecting Jesus to return during their lifetime. It's from Chapter 14: Learning From the Past Without Idolizing the Past: An Honest Look at the New Nestament Church.

<!-- 
The authors said that the early Christians stayed in Jeruselling their properties to distribute to the brethren in need. 

The author said that what's recorded in Acts (Acts chapter 2 to be specific) was just _description_ of the early church instead of _prescription_ for us to emulate
 -->

Here's an image of the page where that claim is stated:

![Accidental Pharisees, Acts, presecription, description, they expected Jesus to return any day](/assets/images/2023/2023-11-09-accidental-pharisees-description-acts-prescription-Jesus-return.jpg)

The author says that the early Christians "expected Jesus to return any day", and that's the reason why they stayed in Jerusalem, and they sold properties to distribute to those in need. The author of the book also speculated that that might have contributed to the poverty of the church in Jerusalem during Paul's time. The author also suggests that what's recorded in Acts chapter 2 are just _descriptions_ of the early church and not _prescriptions_ for us to emulate.

But back to my main point: I did not know that the first disciples of Jesus expected to see his return. Maybe I have read about that in the past and have forgotten. But that claim lingered in my mind while finishing the book  --- Why does the author make that claim? --- I did not bother to google for it because when I was reading that passage it was already late in the evening, and I was a bit sleepy already, but I wanted to finish reading the book.

Then today, while having my lunch, that thought came back to me. And then I also remembered what I had read in John chapter 21 --- that in the early chruch, there was a rumor that John will not die until Jesus' return (read verses 18-23; try reading it in the Easy to Read Version*). This is one evidence that the early Christians really expected Jesus to return during their lifetime!

Then there are Bible passages saying _"the Lord is not slack concerning his promise..."_. That might have been words of comfort to those who expected Jesus to return during their lifetime but did not.

KJV only. Stagnant. Because not understand what they/we are reading.

Not understanding what scripture says might be sometimes beneficial because if we do not understand things we do not know they are wrong so we do not feel guilty, and so we continue with life, or continue attending church, and giving financially, and so the gospel spread...
