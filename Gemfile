# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# To maintain a local Jekyll environment in sync with GitHub Pages replace the 
# gem "jekyll" line with gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins and run the following:
# $ bundle install

gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# To upgrade, run `bundle update`.

# gem "jekyll"
# gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll" # Gem-based themes: https://learn.siteleaf.com/themes/gem-based-themes

gem "wdm", ">= 0.1.0" if Gem.win_platform?
gem "webrick" # https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/test/Gemfile

# The following plugins are automatically loaded by the theme-gem:
#   gem "jekyll-paginate"
#   gem "jekyll-sitemap"
#   gem "jekyll-gist"
#   gem "jekyll-feed"
#   gem "jekyll-include-cache"
#
# If you have any other plugins, put them here!
# Cf. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/installation/
