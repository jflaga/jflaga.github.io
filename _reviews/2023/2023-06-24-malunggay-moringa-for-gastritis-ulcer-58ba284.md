My father used to suffer from ulcers for years. But then he had this idea of using malunngay/moringa leaves extract to cure his gastritis/ulcer.

What he did is something like this:

0. Prepare some sweet candies (like white rabbit)

1. Squeeze the juice from malunggay leaves until you have about 1/4 to 1/2 cup.

2. Drink it all (covering your nose might help, because it does not smell/taste so good)

3. Eat some sweet candy to help with the smell/taste


He did that three times (once every week If I remember correctly).

I hope information that can help others suffering from ulcers.

**Some context/disclaimer:**

This idea of using malunggay to cure ulcer did not come out of thin air.

My father grew up in a culture where malunggay extract is used to treat minor wounds or cuts.

And because ulcer means wound inside the stomach for example, he believed that malunggay can cure it, like it cures external wounds. And so he tried to use it to cure his ulcer, and it worked.  (ref. The End of Modern Medicine, mind matters)

Also note that where my father lives, using malunggay to treat wounds might have been used for centuries, so his body might have been "naturally selected" to respond positively to malunggay extract.

Please pardon my poor English. I will rewrite this post later if I can find a better way to phrase things.
