My father used malunngay/moringa leaves extract to cure his gastritis/ulcer.

What he did is something like this:

0. Prepare some sweet candies (like white rabbit)

1. Squeeze the juice from malunggay leaves until you have between 1/4 and 1/2 cup.

2. Drink it all (covering your nose might help, because it does not smell/taste so good)

3. Eat some sweet candy to help with the smell/taste


He did that three times (once every week If I remember correctly).

I hope that can help others suffereing from ulcers.

**Some context:** (ref. The End of Modern Medicine, mind matters)

Idea of using malunggay to cure ulcer did not come out of thin air.

My father grew up in a culture where malunggay extract is used to treat minor wounds or cuts.

Because ulcer means wound inside the stomach for example, he believes that malunggay can cure it, like it cures external wounds. And so he tried to use it to cure his ulcer, and it worked.

Please pardon my poor English. I will rewrite this review later if I can find a better way to phrase things.
