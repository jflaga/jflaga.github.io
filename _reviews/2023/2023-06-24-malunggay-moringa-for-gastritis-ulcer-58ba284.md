father, moringa leaves extract, 3 times

Context: (ref The End of Modern Medicine, mind matters)

Idea of using malunggay to cure ulcer did not come out of thin air.

Malunggay extract is used to treat wounds (gotten by children when playing for example)

Because ulcer means wound inside the stomach for example, he believes that malunggay can cure it, like it cures external wounds
