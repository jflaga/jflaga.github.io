**TLDR:** No clear instructions about what "personal appearance" means after applying for the civil service exam online.

The Civil Service Commission Region 12 [announced the schedule](https://www.facebook.com/cscregion12/posts/pfbid0nTVa4LgrjJ9A9zBy9b9PjyR7TrDMSvSrTUaaq9XdMoYx1zuN8aJgaZAJNRqRyE9Sl) of the upcoming exams on their Facebook page on March 11, 2023. According to the announcement, the filing period starts on May 22, 2023. 

And it says _"The filing shall be strictly ONLINE."_

So I set reminders on my phone for that date so that I don't forget to submit my application..

On May 22 I attempted to log in to their OCSEAS website, but it spits out an error message saying "Forbidden", so I was not able to submit my application on that day.

I was able to successfully submit my application two days later, on May 24, 2023. 

But I never received any email informing me that my application was successful, even though this image fron the transactions page of their OCSEAS website says that my application was accepted on the next day, May 25, 2023:

Then today, May 28, 2023 PHT, I received an email informing me that my application was cancelled because I _"failed to set the date of [my] personal appearance within the prescribed period of until May 27, 2023"_.

But why? 

I did not receive any email informing me of anything about _personal appearance_. I received only two _recent_ emails from them: the first one was when I registered to their OCSEAS site, and the second one was when my application was cancelled.

Their system might have issues that needs to be fixed.

I'm hoping that the issues will be resolved by the time I submit my application again.

**Update (June 5, 2023):** I just found out that they have instructions about "personal appearance" in an [image in the comments section of their announcement](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=542442864743843&set=p.542442864743843&type=3). They should have appended it to the original post, so that it will not be hard to find.

Also, it says "Check your email and your OCSEAS account from time to time to know the status of your application". I think it would be better if they removed the "Check your email" part of that sentence because their web app currently does not send email notifications for the status.

You might be wondering why I spent so much time to write this review of my experience with the online application for civil service exam. It's because I promised my wife that I can manage to do the application by myself, without the help of others who offered paid services. But I failed her, because I was not able to see the detailed instructions in the comments section of their announcement, which included the details about "personal appearance".
