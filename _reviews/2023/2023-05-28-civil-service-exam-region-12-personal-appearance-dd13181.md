**TLDR:** No clear instructions about what "personal appearance" means after applying for the civil service exam online.

The Civil Service Commission Region 12 [announced the schedule](https://www.facebook.com/cscregion12/posts/pfbid0nTVa4LgrjJ9A9zBy9b9PjyR7TrDMSvSrTUaaq9XdMoYx1zuN8aJgaZAJNRqRyE9Sl) of the upcoming exams on their Facebook page on March 11, 2023. According to the announcement, the filing period starts on May 22, 2023. 

And it says _"The filing shall be strictly ONLINE."_

So I set reminders on my phone for that date so that I don't forget to submit my application..

On May 22 I attempted to log in to their OCSEAS website, but it spits out an error message saying "Forbidden", so I was not able to submit my application on that day.

I was able to successfully submit my application two days later, on May 24, 2023. 

But I never received any email informing me that my application was successful, even though this image fron the transactions page of their OCSEAS website says that my application was accepted on the next day, May 25, 2023:

Then today, May 28, 2023 PHT, I received an email informing me that my application was cancelled because I _"failed to set the date of [my] personal appearance within the prescribed period of until May 27, 2023"_.

But why? 

I did not receive any email informing me of anything about _personal appearance_. I received only two _recent_ emails from them: the first one was when I registered to their OCSEAS site, and the second one was when my application was cancelled.

Their system might have issues that needs to be fixed.

I'm hoping that the issues will be resolved by the time I submit my application again.
